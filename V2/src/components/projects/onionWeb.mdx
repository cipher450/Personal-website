# Hello world!

 

## Syntax highlighting

We also support syntax highlighting in MDX out-of-the-box! This example uses our default [Shiki theme](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki). See the [MDX integration docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#syntax-highlighting) for configuration options.

```astro

const weSupportAstro = true;

<h1>Hey, what theme is that? Looks nice!</h1>
```
